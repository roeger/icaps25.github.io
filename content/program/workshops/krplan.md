# KRPlan: Knowledge Representation Meets Automated Planning

Joint workshop at [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025) and [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/)\
Melbourne, Australia\
November 11, 2025

## Description

Traditionally, the areas of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
(KR) and Automated Planning are related via common connections to
logical theories of acting and sensing, robotics, and temporal
logics.  However, the two research areas have developed in distinct
directions, with the focus of KR research being more on theoretical
results, such as the complexity of logical reasoning, while Automated
Planning research has produced powerful heuristic search approaches
that work on large problems from industry. There is substantial
research interest in the connection between the two fields, with
approaches ranging from temporal reasoning about actions and goals,
answer set planning, ontology-based planning specifications,
epistemic planning, to planning under open-world semantics.

Knowledge Representation Meets Automated Planning (KRPlan) aims at
bringing together researchers from the fields of Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning and Automated Planning to discuss and
develop ideas for applying state-of-the-art techniques from KR and
Planning for modeling and solving complex planning and reasoning
problems. We invite both theoretical and practical contributions
from these areas, including but not limited to:

 * Expressive planning domain models
 * Background knowledge for planning tasks
 * Improved preprocessing and search
 * Heuristic search techniques for reasoning
 * Explanations of dynamic systems
 * Standard formats like PDDL and OWL
 * Tailored search heuristics
 * Theories of actions and processes
 * Situation calculus
 * Temporal logic reasoning
 * Answer set planning
 * Knowledge engineering

## Important Dates

* Paper submission: July 23, 2025
* Notification: August 27, 2025
* Workshop: November 11, 2025

## Submission

We invite extended abstracts of 2-5 pages on topics related to both
KR and Automated Planning. The papers should be formatted in Springer
LNCS Style and submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=krplan2025).

The workshop will only have informal proceedings and the main
purpose is to encourage discussions. We welcome not only papers
covering unpublished results, but also abstracts of previous
publications that fall within the scope of the workshop.
